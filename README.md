# Minimal CMake Example
This project tries to be a minimal cmake example. It covers sources,
resources, dependencies and packaging.

I created this project, because I think the official documentation of
CMake is not the best. It avoidids talking about the actually
important parts to setup a new project, but instead explains and
focuses on unnecessary fuss like how to write configuration headers.

I think that a configuariton headers are something you shouldn't do at
all. In my opinion the project should just compile the source without
any magic happening. Generating configuration headers just makes the
build unnecessarily complicated, and tools that work on the source
code get a harder job. I also disagree that every source folder should
have it's own CMake file. I think when there is no really good reason
do do it otherwise, one CMake file should be enough for the entire
project. In one file you should be able to see everything that is
important to build all parts of the project. This information should
not be scattered around in different source folders within the
project.

## build can fail because of boost

The build of this project might fail, when CMake does not find
boost. This does not mean that there is an error in the
``CMakeLists.txt`` file, it just means, that CMake could not find
boost in your system. You can simply remove the boost dependency, if
you don't want or need it. Or you could tell CMake where to find boost
with ccmake or cmake-gui. It's just there to serve as an example, how
you could declare dependencies that you do not distribute with your
project.

## install boost library
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev  
## install GTEST
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
